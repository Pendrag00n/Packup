# Incremental backup variables:
incremental="false" # If set to true, the backup will be incremental and will use rsync instead of tar

port="445"                    # Default SMB/CIFS port is 445. Default SSH port is 22
SMBmountpath="/var/packup"    # This variable is only used if backup up to a SMB remote location
